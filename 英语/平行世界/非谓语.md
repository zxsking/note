3.定语:
	He is always the first one to come and the last one to leave

		3.I felt to report it to the headmaster my duty.

		He seldom calls me exce pt to ask for money
		
		2)其他的介词可以后接宾语从句在从句中可以用不定式:

### 不定式的逻辑主语

```
每个动词都有一个动词都动作的发出者
谓语的发出者为		主语
非谓语的发出者则为 逻辑主语

I want to go home. 		to go home 的主语为 I
I want you to go home.	to go home 的逻辑主语为 you


(省)To see is to believe		
(省)To learn English well is important.  => It is important to learn English well (it 为形式主语)

To learn English well is important for you(逻辑主语). => it is important for you to learn English well.(it 为形式主语,you为 逻辑主语)


It's adj.(difficult, important, necessary, dangerous...) for sb. to do sth.		外在客观用for

It's adj.(brave, clever, cruel, foolish, honest, kind, polite, selfish, silly, stupid,wise) for sb. to do stb.		内在用of

```

### 不定式的否定

```
I told him to go home.	在to前加not
I told him not to go home.
```

### 不定式练习

1. What __D__ you to make such a decision?		
   A.made	 B.let	 C.had	 D.caused
   只有caused 才是 caused sb. to do形式，其他都不写to
   与其他选项而言 caused sb. to do是   导致某人做某事，所以对于要做的事是不确定的，而made，let，had就有确定的含义所以省to

2. Will you attend the meeting __C__ next month?
   A. to hold	 B. being held	 C. to be held	 D. will be held

   表不确定，且被动 to be held

   

3. The purpose of new technology is to make life easier,__C__ it more difficult.
   A. not making	 B. not make	 C. not to make		 D nor to make

   to make表目的和意图 非谓语的否定直接在to前加not

4. Helen had to shout ___D___above the sound of the music
   A. making herself hear	B. to make herself hear 	
   C. making herself heard 	D. to m ake herself heard
   to make 表意图 句中Helen的意图就是让他自己的声音能够在音乐的声音之上

   且被听到表被动用 to be done 形式

5. The news reporters hurried to the airport, only __B__ the film stars had left.

   A. to tell	  B. to be told	 C. telling	 D.told
   该句中不定式的逻辑主语为 The news reporters 报道是被报告 填 to be told

## 动名词

### 动名词做成分

```yaml
1.作主语/表语:	动名词作主语,谓语动词是单数
	主语后置 it做形式宾语:
        Ating Dangsheng and Huangqi herbs is also for this. => It is also for this ating Dangsheng and Huangqi herbs #变后非常奇怪
        Trying to persuade someone whom you do not know on the internet is no use(no point/a waste time of time) 动名词作主语 通常这三种情况下 可以主语后置 it做形式宾语
	
2.作宾语:
	Vt + doing :
		常见的接动名词作宾语的及物动词： admit, allow, advise, appreciate, avoid, consider, deny, dislike, encourage, enjoy, escape, feel like, forbid, forgive, give up, can not help, imagine, involve, mind, miss, practice, put off, can not stand, suggest 
	介词 + doing:
	 	with/without, for, of, on, at/by, in, to
	 	(in) doing 中 in 经常被省略
	 	to doing 会经常与不定式混淆
	 	常见的搭配:
	 		have difficulty/trouble/problems/a difficult time/ a hard time (in) doing sth.
	 		have fun/pleasure/a good time (in) doing sth.
	 		spend time/money (in) doing sth.
	 		when it comes to
	 		Look forward to
	 		Be/get used to
	 		Devote oneself to
	 		Stick to
```

## 到底是to do还是 doing

```
主要是区别他们作名词（主/宾/表）

to do 不确定  将来|目的|一次性
doing 确定	过去|长期|一直

只接一种		确定[过去]doing		 不确定[将来|之后]to do	
agree				❌					✅
aim					❌					✅
admit				✅					❌
ask					❌					✅
appreciate			✅					❌
avoid				✅					✅
choose 				❌					✅
consider			✅					❌
cant't help			✅					❌
deny				✅					✅
decide				❌					✅
enjoy				✅					✅
expect				❌					✅

finish				✅					❌
fail				❌					✅
give up				✅					❌
hope				❌					✅
intend				❌					✅

miss				✅					❌
manage				❌					✅
offer				❌					✅
pretend				❌					✅
promise				❌					✅
practise			✅					✅
refuse				❌					✅
suggest				✅					✅
wish				❌					✅


两种都接
stop			停止做某事...			停下,去做某事
remember		记得做过某事				记得去做某事
forget			忘记做某事				忘记去做某事
try				尝试做某事					尝试去做某事
mean			意味着做.../意思是做某事		打算做		
need			需要被做					需要做

encourage		encourage doing 鼓励做		encourage sb. to do鼓励某人做某事
ask				ask to do要求做						ask sb. to do请求某人做某事
```

### 动名词的逻辑主语

```
通常 形容词性物主代词/名词所有格/宾格/普通格 可以做动名词的逻辑主语

形容词性物主代词/名词所有格
动名词作主： my smoking here  makes me upset
动名词作宾： Do you mind my/his smoking here?
动名词作表： what troubles me is his/my/tom's smoking here


your tell him what's what is no use. => it is no use your tell him what's what. 


宾格(作动名词宾语)
Do you mind me/he smoking here

普通格(也就是普通名词)
I don't like smoking
I don't like young people smoking
```

```
特殊情况
1.如果动名词的逻辑主语是无生命的东西，就只能用普通格
Is there any hope of Manchester United winning the game?
2.如果动名词的逻辑主语是一个较长的名词词组，那他只能用普通格
Hvae ever heard of a man with common sense refusing such an offer?
Do you remember Rick and morty disappearing in front of us last month?
3.当动名词的逻辑主语是其他代词时，常用普通格
I was astonished at some knocking at the front door this late.
There is no chance of that being settled.

```
