		2)其他的介词可以后接宾语从句在从句中可以用不定式:

```
每个动词都有一个动词都动作的发出者
谓语的发出者为		主语
非谓语的发出者则为 逻辑主语

I want to go home. 		to go home 的主语为 I
I want you to go home.	to go home 的逻辑主语为 you


(省)To see is to believe		
(省)To learn English well is important.  => It is important to learn English well (it 为形式主语)

To learn English well is important for you(逻辑主语). => it is important for you to learn English well.(it 为形式主语,you为 逻辑主语)


It's adj.(difficult, important, necessary, dangerous...) for sb. to do sth.		外在客观用for

It's adj.(brave, clever, cruel, foolish, honest, kind, polite, selfish, silly, stupid,wise) for sb. to do stb.		内在用of

```

### 不定式的否定

   A.made	 B.let	 C.had	 D.caused
   只有caused 才是 caused sb. to do形式，其他都不写to

## 动名词

### 动名词做成分

```yaml
1.作主语/表语:	动名词作主语,谓语动词是单数
	主语后置 it做形式宾语:
        Ating Dangsheng and Huangqi herbs is also for this. => It is also for this ating Dangsheng and Huangqi herbs #变后非常奇怪
        Trying to persuade someone whom you do not know on the internet is no use(no point/a waste time of time) 动名词作主语 通常这三种情况下 可以主语后置 it做形式宾语
	
2.作宾语:
	Vt + doing :
		常见的接动名词作宾语的及物动词： admit, allow, advise, appreciate, avoid, consider, deny, dislike, encourage, enjoy, escape, feel like, forbid, forgive, give up, can not help, imagine, involve, mind, miss, practice, put off, can not stand, suggest 
	介词 + doing:
	 	with/without, for, of, on, at/by, in, to
	 	(in) doing 中 in 经常被省略
	 	to doing 会经常与不定式混淆
	 	常见的搭配:
	 		have difficulty/trouble/problems/a difficult time/ a hard time (in) doing sth.
	 		have fun/pleasure/a good time (in) doing sth.
	 		spend time/money (in) doing sth.
	 		when it comes to
	 		Look forward to
	 		Be/get used to
	 		Devote oneself to
	 		Stick to
